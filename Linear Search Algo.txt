1. The linear search is is a way of finding an element in an array, buy comparing it wi\th each element of the array, until the match is found. The array can be sorted or unsorted.
2. The time complexity for best case scenario(the element found at the frst index) is O(1) -> constant time complexity. In here, the time complexity graph will be constant at one ms.
3. The time complexity for worst case scenario(the element not found at all) is O(n) -> where n is the size of the input array,linear time complexity. In here, the time complexity graph will be linear, meaning the time increases as the array size increases.
4. Space complexity is the amount of extra space the system take to solve a problem.
